Description: A 'ggplot2' extension that enables visualization of
    IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and networks. The address space is
    mapped onto the Cartesian coordinate system using a space-filling
    curve. Offers full support for both IPv4 and IPv6 (Internet Protocol
    versions 4 and 6) address spaces.
