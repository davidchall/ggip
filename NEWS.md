# ggip 0.2.0

* A new layer `geom_hilbert_outline()` can overlay the outline of the Hilbert curve. This can guide the eye to regions that are close in IP address space (#16).
* Improved performance of `stat_summary_address()`, by using an alternative check for missing values (#15).
* `stat_summary_address()` now removes data that were not mapped to the 2D grid (because the address was outside the visualized network). A warning is generated by default, which can be disabled using the `na.rm` argument. This new behavior is consistent with that of native ggplot2 layers (#15).


# ggip 0.1.0

First CRAN release.

* `coord_ip()` provides a unified mapping from IP address space to the 2D grid.
* `stat_summary_address()` summarizes IP addresses on a heatmap.
* `theme_ip_light()` and `theme_ip_dark()` offer sensible default theming for ggip plots.
